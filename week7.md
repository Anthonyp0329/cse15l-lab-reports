# Week 7 Lab Report
Today's topic: Speeding through tasks on the command line!

For the tasks outlined in the lab, I was able to run all of them at once by putting the commands for each step in a Google Doc, then 
by copying all the commands and pasting them at once in the terminal! Using this strategy, I was able to finish steps 4-9 in just 8 seconds
and win the class competition!
    
## Step 4 ##
Step 4 was the only step I didn't paste in. Here's what I did to run this step:   

Keys pressed: <up><enter>
  
The command to login to my account on the ieng6 server, ```ssh cs15lwi23amo@ieng6.ucsd.edu```, was 1 up in the search history, so I 
pressed the up arrow once to access it. When I entered this command, because I set up SSH keys for ieng6 during the lab, it automatically
logged me in without the need for me to type in my password. Here's what the command outputted:

## Steps 5-9 ##
For steps 5-9, I already had all the commands in my computer's clipboard as I had highlighted this whole Google Doc and used Command-C
to copy all the commands. Here's a screenshot of the Google Doc:
